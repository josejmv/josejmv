I want to say things that could destroy but also could build something new, something special.</p> <p>Years of uncontrollable curiosity, years of feelings that could blow my heart, years of hiding the truth to those who are involved in my life, years of being a slave of my own mind.</p> <p>The clock is running, and the time will not stop. The rain is falling, and no one can catch it. The thunders are banging, and the fight is close to happening.</p> <p>By becoming immortal, God would lose his kingdom. By becoming dead, he immortalized his name, and by transcending, he abandoned us with the demons. That's life, that's death, that's the holy glass of destiny.</p>"
